## 2048 Game

### Overview
With the power of React and TypeScript, I dove into my very first game development project. Apart from focusing on the appearance and game logic, I've added a special touch with some Easter eggs. What are they? Well, that's for players to find out!  
*(概要: ReactとTypeScriptを使用して、初めてのゲーム開発に挑戦。見た目とゲームのロジックに注力しただけでなく、イースターエッグとしての隠し機能も追加。具体的な内容は、プレイしてのお楽しみです。)*

### Operating Environment
Tailored primarily on the newest version of Chrome. While it probably vibes well on most modern browsers, there could be a jive out of step on browsers like Safari. Just be a bit mindful when grooving on different stages!
